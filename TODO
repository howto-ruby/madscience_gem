Windows:
  runas /user:Administrator "cmd /C chef-client"  (or equivalent chef-solo)
  install Vagrant and VirtualBox MSI files, check registry for definitive MSI version string

    MSI PLEASE NOTE - For proper idempotence the resource's package_name should be
    the same as the 'DisplayName' registry value in the uninstallation data
    that is created during package installation. The easiest way to
    definitively find the proper 'DisplayName' value is to install the package
    on a machine and search for the uninstall information under the following
    registry keys:
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6464Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
      For maximum flexibility the source attribute supports both remote and local installation packages.
